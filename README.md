# DF_commandlineGUI
A graphical front end to the command line implementation of Dwarf Fortress' world generation routine


This started out as just a tool to help me generate worlds without the fuss of constantly typing things onto a command line interface and buggering something up.  I then started to have additions come to mind that I would like to have for myself.  Things like auto-numbering for the region numbers.  I also liked the thought of grabbing all of the TITLE blocks from the world_gen.txt file.  This would mean no more typing the names only to find out that you hit the wrong key while typing!
